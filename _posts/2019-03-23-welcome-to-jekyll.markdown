Hello, I am Hyungjoo Cha, a Ph.D. Candidate at [SaVAnNa Lab](https://savanna.korea.ac.kr), Korea University, advised by [Prof. Taesu Cheong](https://savanna.korea.ac.kr/wp/?page_id=65). Before joining the SaVAnNa Lab, I was enrolled at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, advised by [Prof. Chungmok Lee](https://chungmok.notion.site/Chungmok-Lee-Ph-D-fed955fe006b471ab5417e5a59925afb).

My major research interest lies upon various optimization problem including logistics, manufacturing and so on. Being so, I like to co-work with many researchers around the world! Please do not hesitate to contact me!
